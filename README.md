# Dimentionality-Reduction-using-PCA
## Having multiple features in our dataset can eventually lead our model to oversit wrt training data & make it more complex for understand and debug. Hence its better to always bring down the dimentions from higher to lower.
## Example of Higher to lower dimentions, demographic information of someone could be Age, Income, Gender, type of employement, Location, and so on and its really not advisable to bring all these features into an algorithm rather we can combine all similarly behaving/patters together so all 5 could become 1/2.
